# Introduction

This is an example.


Simply use normal pandoc-markdown and it will be rendered properly.

This is an example code-block. For more options you should probably play around
with latex and pass the `--listings` options to `pandoc`.
For more information check this [SO post](http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/179926/pandoc-markdown-to-pdf-without-cutting-off-code-block-lines-that-are-too-long).

```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = putStrLn "Hello World"
```

Citations should work in normal pandoc style. For example, check [@Sousa:2013cc]
to for more information about the basis for my thesis.
