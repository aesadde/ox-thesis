# Oxford thesis templates

This repository contains templates to format a dissertation at the University of
Oxford.

I simply adapted the original `ociamthesis` class to be used in conjunction with
pandoc-markdown.

To use simply simply clone the repo and add your content to the files in the
`source` directory and then simple run:

* `make tex` if you want a `.tex` file
* `make pdf` to render the thesis to a `.pdf`
* `make docx` to render the thesis as a word-document.
